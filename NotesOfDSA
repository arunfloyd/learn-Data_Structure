...........LINKED LISTS.......

LINKED LISTS ARE A FUNDAMENTAL DATA STRUCTURE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, USED IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS DUE TO THEIR DYNAMIC SIZE AND EFFICIENT INSERTIONS AND DELETIONS. 

Applications

Music Playlists:--
 In music applications, linked lists can be used to represent playlists where songs can be added, removed, or rearranged easily.

Browser History:--
 Web browsers often use linked lists to manage the history of visited web pages. Users can navigate back and forth through the list.
 
 Implementing Stacks and Queues:--
 
 ......Time Complexity in LL O(n).......
 
 Insertion at the beginning (head): O(1) - Constant time complexity because it only involves changing a few pointers.
Insertion at the end (tail): O(1) - Constant time complexity if you maintain a reference to the tail node.
Insertion at a specific position: O(n) - Linear time complexity because you may need to traverse the list to find the correct position.
Deletion at the beginning (head): O(1) - Constant time complexity because it only involves changing a few pointers.
Deletion at the end (tail): O(1) - Constant time complexity if you maintain a reference to the tail node.
Deletion at a specific position: O(n) - Linear time complexity because you may need to traverse the list to find the correct position.
Searching for an element: O(n) - Linear time complexity because in the worst case, you may need to traverse the entire list.
Accessing an element by index: O(n) - Linear time complexity because you may need to traverse the list from the head to the desired index.
Finding the length of the list: O(n) - Linear time complexity because you need to traverse the entire list to count the number of nodes.
Reversing the list: O(n) - Linear time complexity because you need to traverse the entire list and reverse the pointers.
